Changelog
=========

1.9.3
-----

- Verified that it works on Elgg 1.9 - 1.12 and Elgg 2.0 (therefore should also work on any future Elgg 2.X versions),
- Renaming of plugin folder (and plugin id) from setNoNotifications to set_no_notifications because Packagist doesn't allow upper case letter in repo names (without renaming a composer based install wouldn't have been possible to offer),
- composer.json added.

1.9.2.1
-------

- Fixed a deprecation issue on Elgg 1.9 with 'login', 'user' event. It's now 'login:after', 'user'.
